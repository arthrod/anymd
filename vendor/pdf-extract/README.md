# anymd-pdf-extract

A fork of [`pdf-extract`](https://crates.io/crates/pdf-extract) `0.12.1`
(MIT, (c) Jeff Muizelaar, see `LICENSE`), published so that
[`anymd`](https://github.com/SylphxAI/anymd) can be installed with
`cargo install anymd`; crates.io does not accept patched path dependencies.
The library is still named `pdf_extract`. If you are not using anymd, use the
upstream crate.

Changes from upstream 0.12.1:

- Form XObjects run with the current transformation matrix, so figure text
  lands where it is drawn instead of at the page origin.
- Image XObjects are no longer parsed as content streams.
- `OutputDev::image` also receives the image's XObject id (when the page's
  resources name it by reference), so a caller can export the image's bytes.
- Every path-painting operator (`f*`, `B`, `b`, `s`) reaches the output device,
  so table rules are reported.
- It depends on `anymd-adobe-cmap-parser`, the fork that does not panic on
  malformed CMaps.

The upstream README follows.
